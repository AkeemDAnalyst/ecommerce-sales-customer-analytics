## 📌 Overview  
This is a **portfolio project** where I analyze an **E-commerce dataset** end-to-end using **SQL, Power BI, and GitHub**.  
The project simulates real-world data analytics work from data cleaning, to analysis, to creating dashboards, and documenting insights.  


## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** → Data cleaning & transformation  
- **Power BI** → Visualization & dashboards  
- **Draw.io** → Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) & workflow design  
- **GitHub** → Version control & portfolio showcase  
- **Notion** → Project documentation & planning  


## 📂 Project Workflow  
1. **Planning & Documentation** → Project scope, dataset understanding, ERD  
2. **Data Cleaning (SQL)** → Handle nulls, standardize categories, create clean views  
3. **Analysis (SQL)** → Write queries to answer business questions  
4. **Visualization (Power BI)** → Build interactive dashboards  
5. **Project Packaging (GitHub + LinkedIn)** → Share results  


## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset includes multiple tables:  
- **Orders** → order status, purchase date, delivery date, etc.  
- **Order Items** → products, sellers, prices, shipping costs  
- **Customers** → customer location & demographics
